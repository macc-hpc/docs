## Determining what resources to request

Before submitting a job for processing, it is essential to know the requirements of your application so that it can be run properly. Because each application has unique requirements it is advisable to determine what resources you need before you submit your script.

Do not forget that while increasing the amount of compute resources you request may decrease the time it takes to run your job, it will also increase the time you have to wait in queue for using those resources. If you think that your job will not finish in under 2 hours, use the long-run queue instead of the base queue.
