# Overview

Slurm is the utility used for batch processing support, so all jobs must be run through it. This section provides information for getting started with job execution at the Bob cluster.


<!-- Bob's job scheduler is the Slurm Workload Manager. Slurm commands enable you to submit, manage, monitor, and control your jobs. Jobs submitted to the scheduler are queued, then run on the compute nodes.

Each job consumes Core hours which are then charged to your project. -->
