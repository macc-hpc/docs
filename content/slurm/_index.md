# Overview

Slurm is an open source, fault tolerant, and scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for Linux clusters. When working as a workload manager, Slurm is responsible for various tasks. First, it allocates the resources to users over a period of time, depending on the type of job that the user submits (normal or long run), so they can perform work. Secondly, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and managing work on the set of allocated nodes. Lastly, it controls contention for resources for managing a queue of pending work.
